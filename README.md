I started learning about redux recently, and one of the selling points for me
was that Redux is decoupled from React. But unfortunately the tutorial was 
only was written for React.

I have no idea how to use it or how it works, so I decided to make a Proof Of Concept
to show people how to work with redux and that you don't really need a Framework
to create modular and structored webapps.


How to run:
-----

Clone the repository and open `index.html` on your browser. that's it, no package manager, no build tools, just a browser.
